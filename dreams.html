	<h1>Recent Dreams I've Had</h1>
	<i>No psychoanalyzing!</i>
	<p>~</p>
	<b>Dream #1</b>
	<p></p>
	<img src="http://static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/54038993cd3b56950e000259/blade_runner-final.jpg" alt="blade runner" height="200" width="300">
	<p>It was night time and I was running from some Blade Runner-type villans but still found myself <br>cornered by one. He was summoning some power with his hands to be used on me, I thought to myself:<br>
	"You are powerless"...but in my panic I ended up screaming it aloud. As the words came out, my <br>
	voice was extremely powerful and demonic, it froze this sci fi soldier in his tracks.</p>
		<p></p>
	<p>Unfortunately, the dream went on to have me try and use my new superpowers on helpless pedestrians<br>
	In some suburban restraunt I tried freezing a waiter with no success. My attempts became more pathetic<br> and my ego was rightfully deflated.</p>

<b>Dream #2</b>
	<p></p>

			<p>This one I am at what seems like the end of some massive wedding.  People are dressed <br>
			up but  untucked and loose.  I realise there are friends from all three places I've lived <br>in my live and they are all becoming friends.</p>
			<p>At some point we rush out to the ocean and are all pulling up our nice clothes to go<br>
			in shin-deep.
			<p>Then someone screams out "gators!!"</p>
<b>Dream #3</b>
	<p></p>
	<img src="http://i4.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article4038752.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Robin-Williams.jpg" alt="robin" height="200" width="300">
		<p>I am in line with hundreds of people in some sort of catacombs. As I get closer to the front<br>
		<p>of the line i see a cryptkeeper is opening a casket for the person at the front to look into.<br>
		<p>Each person must feign a 'laugh' at the body inside. It is some sort of ritual I don't <br>
		<p>understand. When its my turn the casket is opened and I see that it is Robin Williams.<br></p>
